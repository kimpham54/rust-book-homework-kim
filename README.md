Working through the Rust book, I've always wanted to learn lower level programming. Some notes along the way, really just for me but maybe you'll appreciate them too.

## THE RUST BOOK

### Chapter 1

your app code is in src/main.rs

`rustc main.rs`

#### cargo

`cargo new app_name`

`cargo build`

`cargo run`

`cargo check` if you don't want an executable and checks if it compiles

`cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations

#### Macros, functions, methods in Rust
macro - writes code that writes other code, metaprogramming. println! expands to produce more code

Macros are executed at compile time. They generally expand into new pieces of code that the compiler will then need to further process.

functions are your everyday blocks of code which runs when it's called. most programs are designed to pass data and return data

methods are like functions but is used in the context of a struct type, first parameter being self. functions more loosey goosey 

lambda functions - small anonymous functions https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp

### Chapter 2

#### The standard library
prelude - set of items in the standard library generally in scope in every rust program https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html

stdin - standard input allows you to handle user input

`let apple` - immutable

`let mut apple` - mutable variable

use std::io - standard library, in it is the input/output library. :: indicates scope, so io is part of (in the scope of) std

`std::io::stdin` - the stdin function from the io module which allows handling of user input

can write as `io::stdin()`, returns an instance of std::io::Stdin

#### References
if i do `.read_line(&mut apple)`, the method .read_line appends the standard input from the user and appends it into a string without overwriting its contents and passes that as an argument. the method can change the string's content. & indicates the argument is a reference, which lets multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without copying into memory many times. rust makes it safe and easy to use references. references are immutable by default, use &mut guess instead of &guess to make it mutable

#### enum, struct, matching

#### Result
Result - a value you get after read_line is executed, it is an enumeration (enum) type. the purpose of Result is to encode error-handling information

variants: `Ok` and `Err`. Ok - success. Err - fail with more info

An instance of result has an expect method that you can use. Err will cause the program to crash. ok will take the return value Ok is holding and return it for you to use. The value in this case is the number of bytes of the user's input.

Error handling to suppress warnings is the right way to write a program, rather than just use expect and let a program crash.

#### Crate
a crate is a collection of rust source code files

a binary crate is an executable

a library crate contains code intended to be used in other programs and cannot be executed on its own. add as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`.

`Cargo.lock` contains details of build history that is helpful for compiling in the future, it knows what versions worked

`cargo update`

`cargo doc --open` builds documentation based on methods and functions used

Rust has a strong, static type system. It also has type inference and can guess when something should be for example a string, didn't make you write the type when using String::new()

some number types
- i32: 32 bit number
- u32: unsigned 32 bit number
- i64: 64 bit


## OTHER NOTES

## RUST IN ACTION

closure - anonymous or lambda

stderr error logs
stdoutput normal print logs

fields variable is annotated with the type `Vec<_>`. Vec is shorthand for _vector_, a collection type that can expand dynamically. The underscore (_) instructs Rust to infer the type of the elements.

`if let Ok(length) = fields[1].parse ::<f32>()` reads as “attempt to parse fields[1] as a 32-bit floating-point number and, if that is successful, then assign the number to the length variable.


Dangling pointers—Live references to data that has become invalid over the course of the program (see listing 1.3)

Data races—The inability to determine how a program will behave from run to run because external factors change (see listing 1.4)

Buffer overflow—An attempt to access the 12th element of an array with only 6 elements (see listing 1.5)

Iterator invalidation—An issue caused by something that is iterated over after being altered midway through (see listing 1.6)
